# koa-poc

## About
This project was going to be a real project but it had its problems in the beginning and was discontinued so I decided to open it to the public as a proof of concept

## Run in development

```sh
# Install the dependencies
$ yarn

# Copy the envs
$ cp .env.example .env

# Run the docker to get a database container
$ docker-compose up -d

# Migrate the database
$ yarn prisma migrate dev

# Just run
$ yarn dev
```
